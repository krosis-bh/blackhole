# blackhole

This is an accurate black hole simulation which uses the Hamiltonian form of geodesics. Currently implemented in the Godot 4.4.

It currently supports 3 metrics: Schwartzschild, Kerr-Newman, and the Alcubierre Drive.

The controls are clunky. You use TAB to switch between interface and freecam mode. In inferface mode, parameters of the metric can be adjusted.
